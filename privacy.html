            <br/><br/>
            1. Introduction
            <br/><br/>
            To summarize this privacy policy: we don't collect, store, use, and/or share any of your information when you use our services. None of our mobile applications or services access the internet, and none will in the future, so they in fact physically cannot collect / store any user information on any servers for as long as this is true.
            <br/><br/>
            2. Information We Don't Collect
            <br/><br/>
            We want to be clear: when you use our services:
            <br/><br/>
            We DO NOT collect personal or non-personal information.<br/>
            We DO NOT use cookies or any tracking mechanisms.<br/><br/>
            We DO NOT access, store, use, or share any data or information from your device or usage of it outside of the localized game data mentioned below, which is necessary for saving progress.<br/><br/>
            3. Localized Game Data
            <br/><br/>
            Our mobile applications may store game scores, settings, or other game state information locally on your device. This data is entirely anonymous, as our app does not have a registration mechanism or any means to link this data to a specific individual. The data remains on your device and is neither transmitted nor accessed by us under any circumstance.
            <br/><br/>
            4. Third-Party Services
            <br/><br/>
            Our services DO NOT integrate with or utilize third-party services, tools, or libraries that collect or process personal or non-personal data.
            <br/><br/>
            5. User Rights
            <br/><br/>
            Given that we do not collect any data beyond localized game information, user rights related to data access, correction, and erasure as outlined in various data protection regulations are inherently addressed.
            <br/><br/>
            6. Data Retention and Deletion Policy
            <br/><br/>
            Since we do not collect or store personal or sensitive user data, there is no data retention applicable to our services. Users have full control over the localized game data stored on their devices and can delete it at any time by uninstalling the app.
            <br/><br/>
            7. Sensitive Data Security
            <br/><br/>
            We do not store any sensitive or personal user data, and the non-sensitive data that our services store is stored entirely locally and never accessed by us.
            <br/><br/>
            8. Changes to this Policy
            <br/><br/>
            We are committed to the stance outlined in this policy, but should any changes be made in the future, we will update this policy and notify users accordingly.
            <br/><br/>
            9. Contact Us
